# 🚀 Jetpack Compose Animations & State Management  

This repository contains my **practice project** where I explored and implemented various **animations, StateFlows, and side effects** in Jetpack Compose. The goal of this project is to understand and experiment with different Compose APIs to create smooth and efficient UI interactions.  

## 📌 Features Covered  

### 🎬 **Animations in Jetpack Compose**  
✅ **Simple Animations** (e.g., `animateFloatAsState`, `animateDpAsState`)  
✅ **Crossfade & Visibility Animations** (`AnimatedVisibility`, `Crossfade`)  
✅ **Advanced Motion Animations** (`MotionLayout`, `AnimatedContent`)  
✅ **Spring, Tween, and Keyframe Animations**  

### 🔄 **State Management**  
✅ **StateFlow & SharedFlow** in ViewModel  
✅ **Remember & MutableState** for local state handling  
✅ **LiveData & StateFlow Interop**  

### ⏳ **Side Effects in Compose**  
✅ `LaunchedEffect` for one-time actions  
✅ `SideEffect` for non-recomposing operations  
✅ `DisposableEffect` for resource cleanup  
✅ `ProduceState` & `rememberUpdatedState`  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Jetpack Compose**  
- **Kotlin**  
- **StateFlow, SharedFlow**  
- **MotionLayout (ConstraintLayout in Compose)**  

## 🔥 How to Run the Project  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-Dev-R/Jetpack-Compose.git
   ```
2. Open in **Android Studio** (Arctic Fox or newer).  
3. Sync Gradle and Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
